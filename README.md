# Three-Level-Mixed-Model-of-Classroom-Data
This is a project I developed as a research assistant in the lab of clinical psychologist Dr. Dillon Browne at the University of Waterloo.
Our goal was to analyze classroom behaviour in Toronto during COVID-19 in order to make recommendations to the school board for resource allocation and policy changes in the coming year.
This three level mixed model seeks to understand which variables mediated and moderated the relationship between demographic factors of children and educators, and measures of inappropriate behaviour (DESSA Mini Scale) and physical literacy (TEAF Clinical Scale).
